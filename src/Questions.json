      "Question": "Where are my 3D models? Why does my model not import but it is a supported file type?",
      "Answer": "3D models are not included with HitFilm. Instead, you can import your own 3D models, in a similar way to importing your video footage. You can create your own models in programs like 3D Studio Max, Cinema4D and Blender or download models from the internet.\nHitFilm supports a variety of common formats: LWO, OBJ, 3DS, FBX and ABC. These formats incorporate a wide variety of features. While most will work in HitFilm, some may use specific features which are not currently supported in HitFilm.\nHitFilm Express supports 3D model import, but renders them with a watermark unless the 3D: Model Render add-on pack is purchased and enabled."

This revolutionary workflow provides a super-fast, interactive approach to post-production."

      "Question": "Can I import 3D models?",
      "Answer": "HitFilm is the only editor-compositor able to import 3D models without needing extra plug-ins. Multiple formats (.fbx, .lwo, .obj, .abc and .3ds) can be imported to HitFilm Pro and composited on the timeline like any other asset. HitFilm Pro supports lwo, .obj, .abc, .fbx and .3ds. The .abc and .fbx formats support animation data. Earlier versions of HitFilm Pro will support fewer 3D formats.\n3D models are listed alongside your videos, images and audio for easy access and include texturing, self-shadowing and shadow casting and group animation features. 3D models integrate with HitFilm’s interface and effects, making them fast and easy to use."

It is fully customizable and capable of an unlimited variety of visual effects. The Particle Simulator is fully enabled in HitFilm Pro.

      "Question": "Can I create lens flares?",
      "Answer": "You certainly can! HitFilm includes several advanced effects for creating your own lens flares and light effects.\nLight flares are fully customizable and lens artefacts animate automatically as the flare is moved. Flares can even be linked to motion tracking data to create advanced animation. Both HitFilm Pro and HitFilm Express include standard Light Flares and Auto Light Flares, which identifies the brightest parts of your shot and applies realistic lens flares."

If you renew during an existing update period, the renewal will begin the day that your existing update period ends. If you renew after your update period has expired, then the renewal begins on the day you purchase.\nFor example, if you purchase your license on April 8, 2019, then purchase a renewal one month later, on May 8 2019, the renewal period will begin on April 8 2020 and extend until April 8, 2021.\nIf you purchase your license on April 8, 2019, then wait 18 months to purchase a renewal, on October 8, 2020, then the renewal period will begin on October 8, 2020 and extend to October 8, 2021."
